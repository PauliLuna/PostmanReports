# Newman Runner
How to set up GitHub actions to tell your tests to run each time code is updated on your GitHub repo.

We'll use GitHub actions to automatically run a Newman command that will execute any tasks in your Postman collection and output those to a report.

## Steps
1. Create a repo with the collection and environment. 
2. Create a new file on /.github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml
3. Hit "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" and click "Propose new file".
4. Then click "Create pull request".
5. If we select "Details", we can see what's happening. You can also do this from the "Actions" tab.
